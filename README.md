Home inventory - a student work for Haaga-Helia - k35 Back End programming claa

Have you ever had the dilemma of not remembering do you hava running shoes the size of 38 or spare rope or where did you store the tent when you used it 7 year ago. On this application you can find where you restored it. With three children we have a lot of stuff we just can't remember or find when we need it. It would be so much easier to check out what size ice skates we have than to go through all of them.

I'm planning to use external database, so our family could actually use this and preferably from mobile device, but that might not happen during this course. 

My plan is also to create a bigger database from the start so it is easy to add pictures etc later on.
